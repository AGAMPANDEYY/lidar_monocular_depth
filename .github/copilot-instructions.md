# Copilot Instructions for lidar_monocular_depth

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be in the early stages of development. The README is currently empty, and no source code or documentation files are present yet. The project name suggests a focus on depth estimation using LiDAR and monocular vision, likely for robotics, autonomous vehicles, or computer vision research.

## Immediate Guidance for AI Agents
- **No code or workflow files are present yet.** Agents should expect to scaffold the project from scratch or request further user guidance.
- **No build, test, or run instructions are available.** If implementing features, clarify the intended language, framework, and data flow with the user.
- **No project-specific conventions or patterns are discoverable.** Use standard best practices for new projects unless directed otherwise.
- **No integration points or external dependencies are defined.** Agents should ask the user about required libraries, data sources, or hardware integration.

## Actionable Steps for AI Agents
1. **Scaffold the project structure** if starting from scratch (e.g., src/, tests/, docs/, environment files).
2. **Prompt the user for missing context**: programming language, frameworks, target platform, and any existing design decisions.
3. **Document all new conventions and workflows** in the README and this file as the project evolves.
4. **Reference this file for future updates** as the codebase grows and patterns emerge.
